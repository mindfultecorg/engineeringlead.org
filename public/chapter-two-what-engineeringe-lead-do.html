        <h1>Chapter 2. What Do Engineering Leads Actually Do?</h1>
        <p>
            Engineering Leads are servant leaders. 
            They are dedicated to serving three “clients” within the organization: software engineers, project managers, and executives.
        </p>
        <h2>Software Engineers</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Vinh Nguyen</strong>
            <p><strong><sup>" <sup></strong>
                I don't care how long a member stays in the company. 
                But when a member leaves the company, when looking back the entire time, 
                he or she acknowledged that he/she had grown a lot since joining the company.
                If we have a member stay in the company for 3 years, it counts as a success.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            For Vinh, an Engineering Lead at mesoneer AG, success isn't merely measured in tenure 
            but in the growth experienced by each member during their tenure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey of a software engineer within the company is a saga 
            that involves the watchful eye and active involvement of an Engineering Lead at every turn:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Interviewing</strong>
                <p>
                    They engage in the meticulous process of selecting new talent, 
                    recognizing potential and aligning it with the company's ethos.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onboarding</strong>
                <p>
                    Assimilating newcomers into the team culture, 
                    guiding them through the labyrinth of processes, tools, and methodologies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Coaching</strong>
                <p>
                    A constant mentorship role that extends beyond technical proficiency 
                    nurturing holistic growth, and skill enhancement.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Working</strong>
                <p>
                    Actively participating in the ongoing projects, collaborating, offering guidance
                    and fostering an environment conducive to innovation and problem-solving.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Off-boarding</strong>
                <p>
                    Even when a journey concludes, an Engineering Lead ensures a graceful exit,
                    gathering feedback, and facilitating the departing member's 
                    growth by aiding them in acknowledging their achievements and learning during their tenure.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Managers</h2>
        <p>
            An Engineering Lead also functions as a linchpin between the technical sphere and the realms of project management and sales. 
            They ensure the quality and success of software projects by offering invaluable technical opinions and decisions. 
            Their involvement spans across creating an optimal working environment, overseeing the infrastructure, 
            and advocating for the right tools and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their role extends into project planning, aiding executives in determining which team is best suited for specific projects 
            based on skills, strengths, and workload.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Engineering Leads are pivotal in pre-sales activities, leveraging their technical acumen to support the sales team, 
            providing insights that bridge the gap between client expectations and technical feasibility.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Executives</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond the immediate team, Engineering Leads are conduits between the ground reality and the higher echelons of the organization. 
            They navigate the intricate web of people issues, focusing on career paths, skill acquisition, and fostering an environment 
            that nurtures continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, Engineering Leads are instrumental in marketing endeavors, strategizing on how to elevate the company's visibility 
            and brand in the competitive market landscape.
        </p>
