        <h1>Chapter 2. What Do Engineering Leads Actually Do?</h1>
        <p>
            Engineering Leads are servant leaders. 
            They are dedicated to serving three “clients” within the organization: software engineers, project managers, and executives.
        </p>
        <h2>Software Engineers</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Vinh Nguyen</strong>
            <p><strong><sup>" <sup></strong>
                I don't care how long a member stays in the company. 
                But when a member leaves the company, when looking back the entire time, 
                he or she acknowledged that he/she had grown a lot since joining the company.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            For Vinh, an Engineering Lead at mesoneer, success isn't merely measured in tenure 
            but in the growth experienced by each member during their tenure. 
            He firmly believes, “If we have a member stay in the company for 3 years, it counts as a success.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey of a software engineer within the company is a saga 
            that involves the watchful eye and active involvement of an Engineering Lead at every turn:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Interviewing</strong>
                <p>
                    They engage in the meticulous process of selecting new talent, 
                    recognizing potential and aligning it with the company's ethos.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onboarding</strong>
                <p>
                    Assimilating newcomers into the team culture, 
                    guiding them through the labyrinth of processes, tools, and methodologies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Coaching</strong>
                <p>
                    A constant mentorship role that extends beyond technical proficiency 
                    nurturing holistic growth, and skill enhancement.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Working</strong>
                <p>
                    Actively participating in the ongoing projects, collaborating, offering guidance
                    and fostering an environment conducive to innovation and problem-solving.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Off-boarding</strong>
                <p>
                    Even when a journey concludes, an Engineering Lead ensures a graceful exit,
                    gathering feedback, and facilitating the departing member's 
                    growth by aiding them in acknowledging their achievements and learning during their tenure.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
